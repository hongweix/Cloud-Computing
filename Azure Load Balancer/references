People who I talked with for help:
At first, I did not use multi-threading to deal with Health Check and Senior System Architect test, but found it is really difficult to arrive the rps required, then I discussed with my team member Yujie Li (yujiel) with the concepts of multi-threading and the idea of blocking one thread while still continuing other threads. Finally, I choose to use multi-threading to finish the last two test.
